\value{
Profile likelihood for \code{theta}: the value of the observed-data log-likelihood after profiling out other parameters.
}
\description{
For a given vector \code{theta} to parameterize P(Y|X,C), this function repeats the EM algorithm to find
the values of \code{p} at convergence. The resulting parameters are used to find the profile
log-likelihood for \code{theta} by plugging them into the observed-data log-likelihood.
This function is used by \code{pl_theta()}.
